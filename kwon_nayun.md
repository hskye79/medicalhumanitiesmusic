# The Fault in Our Stars

“All of the Stars” captures the loss, love, and fear of death felt by the two main characters through its gentle and lyrical melody. Instead of easing the harsh reality of cancer, the lyrics blend hope and farewell, conveying a heartfelt tone that quietly accepts sorrow and seeks to live through it together. The film portrays cancer not only as a physical illness but also as an emotional and relational burden that reshapes how individuals connect with each other and find meaning in limited time. By focusing on the daily lives and inner emotions of young patients, the story sheds light on the human side of illness, challenging social discomfort around discussing terminal disease and emphasizing the importance of empathy, dignity, and shared experience in the face of mortality.
