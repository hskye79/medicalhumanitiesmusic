# Silenced

The main theme of the film "Silenced" employs a deep, heavy string melody to poignantly portray the pain experienced by hearing-impaired children and the societal silence surrounding their suffering. Rather than exaggerating the scenes, the music conveys sorrow with a restrained emotional tone, allowing the audience to engage more sincerely with the characters’ anguish. Through its somber and minimalist approach, the score deepens the emotional resonance of the film, emphasizing the gravity of the injustice and the need for awareness and change.

A similar disease is discussed in [*A Silent Voice*](lim_seokhyeon.md). That piece also uses delicate and ambient piano sounds to portray emotional isolation and the experience of hearing impairment, highlighting disability not just as a physical condition but as an emotional reality.
